`The self configuration tool is a 
solution I designed and implemented

The goal was to provide the user with
the power to customize column names,
order, and visibility without needing 
an engineer to update the template.

Changes in the tool are sent to a Java
micro-service which creates an override
for the template.`;

edit icon on the component in the table
and opening up a modal, or by clicking the
arrows to cycle through statuses.

The status set via clicking an arrow is
debounced to prevent unnecessary post
requests.

history listings is supported with a 
character count restriction.
